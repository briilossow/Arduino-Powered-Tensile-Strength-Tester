------------- System Use -------------

1. Ensure the microSD card is properly inserted into the slot

2. Plug system into laptop for power using the USB cable, or directly into wall using the power adapter

3. Load clamps with material to be tested

4. Press "Calibrate" on the touch screen and increase or decrease the weight until satisfied, then press "Done" to apply the change

5. Press "Start" to begin taking measurements

6. Once the screen informs the user to begin, pull rope at a slow, controlled speed to stretch the material
	6a. If approaching the max load capacity of 20kg, the system will warn the user by use of a buzzer speaker

7. Once data collection is complete, touch the screen to return to main menu

8. Repeat steps 3-7 for each sample tested

9. Once all testing is complete, press "Export" on the touch screen and remove the microSD card when prompted.

10. Insert the card into a laptop or computer and open the included CSV files in Excel or other programs for analysis

11. Calculate Material Area & Stress
	11a. Please calculate material cross-sectional area in meters
	11b. Stress = Applied Force / Material Area

12. Plot Stress-Strain Curve using Excel or other data analysis program 

13. Calculate ultimate tensile strength and Young's modulus using the graphs

14. Repeat steps 11-13 for each sample tested
